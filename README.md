# Code-Louisville-Project- Python

This is a final project for Code Louisville. My final goal is to completely re-program the website I created in Front end class in Python. For this particular project and class, I started with several elements. 

Please contact me for a link to run this project in Google Colab. 

An ipynb file can be downloaded to run this file. Google colab has to be downloaded first. https://colab.research.google.com/

An breakdown file with explanations to each part from Colab has been posted on Git Hub, in order to obtain a full file please email me. 

Please download the following extentions prior to running the project:
-import pandas 
-import matplotlib.pyplot


The requirenments that have been met for this project are:
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data (Population of people in different cities in Ukraine)
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app (Weather)
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) (Countdown clock until next trip)

I look forward to working on this and convert my cite to Python!
